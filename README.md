# Age of Empires 2 - Counters 
As I am trying to learn classes in Python and how they work with each other, I started (a long time ago, and a few times) building an Age of Empires 2 Counter application. There is another repository with the same goal, that is more complete and integrates a webscrapper and I plan to merge this class-approach to that one.
